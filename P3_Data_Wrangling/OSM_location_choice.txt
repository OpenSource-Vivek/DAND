As described in my project report introduction, I chose to investigate the OSM data for the city of Portland, OR where I currently reside. Since this is where I live and care deeply about, I hope to continue to work with OSM data in the future and contribute to open data projects in Portland.

Portland, OR is a medium size city on the West Coast of the USA, located in a region commonly known as the Pacific Northwest. In recent years, it has been popularly parodied in the TV series, Portlandia, which is a satirical look at some of the more extreme parts of Portaland's urban liberal culture.
